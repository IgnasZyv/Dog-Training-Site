I have used a css library called scss, that's why there will be 3 files in one css folder: file.css, file.css.map and file.scss. The website uses css, but I wrote css code in .scss files.

For some of the pages I used the jquery library I linked it html head so the browser should grab it automatically.

I have folders for every extention css, js db, php they contain appropriate files.

database connection is inside the db folder.
